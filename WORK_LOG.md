| December 3  | 11:15 - 11:55 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            How I am going to attempt to do this is similar to what we discussed in class. I want to create 6 bit codes for each letter and create 10 bit codes for common words in english. During this time, I implemented a map where the index is the letter and the value is the 6 bit binary code. |
| December 3  |  5:20 - 6:00  |                                                                             The next step was somehow making it so that whenever we encounter a very common word, we turn it into a 10 bit code. For this I decided to use a hashmap since whenever we encounter a word, we can check if it is in the hashmap first and get the 10 bit code. Additionally, I decided have the hashmap hold the top 15 most common words and singed a unique 10 bit binary code. It is not efficient, maybe there is a way of using a for/while loop, but I have 30 lines of code doing this which I believe is not ideal. Another idea I had was using an arraylist however I would have to make 2 so that one holds the words and the other the codes. |
| December 3  |  6:45 - 8:00  | During this time, I worked on going through the file and converting letters or words into their assigned code. At first, I used a while loop and started reading the code byte by byte so I can get each letter. However, I realized that I could just use the method read string and get all the letters into 1 string like in genomecompressor. Therefore, I replaced the while loop with a for loop that goes over the read String. I first keep adding letters into a string until we reach a space (letting us know the end of a word). Afterwards, I check if it is a word in the hashmap and if it is, I write the escape character and the 10 bit code. Otherwise, I go through the word and write each letter as a 6 bit code. |
| December 4  | 10:45 - 11:15 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Spent most of this time thinking of way to finish the expand method. After some time, I decided to use the same sort of method we used in genome compressor. We have the same arrays as the compression however swapped. So now, for the map in the expand algorithm, the index is the code and the value is the letter that was assigned to that code in the compress function. |

I made sure I know what each function does so I don't get confused. Additionally, I started working on the compression method where I worked on adding letters into the trie and assigning their own code. My next step is to begin looking at the following character and adding it to the TST as well. |
| December 8  |  8:20 - 9:30  |                                                    Finished my compressed function. During this time, I was adding the part where you look at the next character to the prefix and assign it a code. It was pretty simple but after thinking about it, I realized I needed to add a condition so that we don't go out of bounds. And so, my condition was where as long as my index isn't the last character, add the next char. Additionally, I realized that I needed to somehow make it so that the prefix can be two chars or more so I can write the code I originally assigned it too And so, I added a while loop where as long as I don't get EMPTY when checking if the prefix is in my TST, I add the next char to my prefix. |

Started working on the expand function. Right now I have a map filled with the extended ascii chars. In the map, the index is the code that was originally assigned in the compressed function and the value is the lookahead string. |
| December 10 |  7:20 - 8:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                Finished the expand function so that it can create lookahead strings and also coded the edge case where we don't know the lookahead code. I had some problems with abra because my algorithm kept on skipping chars. I realized it was because when I do index += prefix.length, I added length of the prefix when you added the car so now it was actually prefix length + 1. I deleted the code and changed a bit so that it adds index correctly. However, whenever I try to run alice or shakespeare, I keep getting it wrong and I am not sure why. |
