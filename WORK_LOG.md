I want to create 6 bit codes for each letter and create 10 bit codes for common words in english. During this time, I implemented a map where the index is the letter and the value is the 6 bit binary code. |

For this I decided to use a hashmap since whenever we encounter a word, we can check if it is in the hashmap first and get the 10 bit code. Additionally, I decided have the hashmap hold the top 15 most common words and singed a unique 10 bit binary code. It is not efficient, maybe there is a way of using a for/while loop, but I have 30 lines of code doing this which I believe is not ideal. Another idea I had was using an arraylist however I would have to make 2 so that one holds the words and the other the codes. |
| December 3 |  6:45 - 8:00  | During this time, I worked on going through the file and converting letters or words into their assigned code. At first, I used a while loop and started reading the code byte by byte so I can get each letter. However, I realized that I could just use the method read string and get all the letters into 1 string like in genomecompressor. Therefore, I replaced the while loop with a for loop that goes over the read String. I first keep adding letters into a string until we reach a space (letting us know the end of a word). Afterwards, I check if it is a word in the hashmap and if it is, I write the escape character and the 10 bit code. Otherwise, I go through the word and write each letter as a 6 bit code. |

After some time, I decided to use the same sort of method we used in genome compressor. We have the same arrays as the compression however swapped. So now, for the map in the expand algorithm, the index is the code and the value is the letter that was assigned to that code in the compress function. |
